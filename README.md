# PAGE 2019 PBPK Workshop
## PK-Sim® &amp; MoBi® (OSP Suite) workshop on PBPK

esqLABS is running a one-day hands-on **PK-Sim® & MoBi®** workshop on **basic concepts in PBPK** on **Tuesday 11th of June** at the **United Spaces Waterfront** in **Stockholm, Sweden** as a satellite meeting to PAGE 2019. The workshop covers age-dependent PK, population simulations and drug-drug-interactions (DDI) in PBPK modeling using PK-Sim for DMPK, pediatric and geriatric investigations by leveraging physiological and mechanistic knowledge for translational modeling in your drug R&D program. 
During hands-on exercises you will learn how to:

- [x] Build a PBPK model in PK-Sim and compare to observed data
- [x] Learn how to consider age-dependency in drug PK in PK-Sim (Pediatrics and Geriatrics)
- [x] Conduct population simulations in PK-Sim and MoBi
- [x] Learn how to model drug-drug interactions in PK-Sim (DDI)

and, if time permits:
- [x] Conduct parameter identifications in PK-Sim and MoBi
- [x] Simulate and analyze your PBPK-QSP model in R

This workshop will be held by consultants & scientists from esqlabs GmbH with extensive experience in the use of **PK-Sim® & MoBi®** in all application areas. 

While the workshop does not require any prior experience with PK-Sim® & MoBi®, many topics will be of interest even for advanced users.

## REGISTRATION

To register for the workshop, please visit [EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/workshop-on-pbpk-with-pk-sim-mobi-osp-suite-registration-54750727901).

The workshop is currently restricted to 20 participants.

Registration includes coffee- and lunch breaks.

## AGENDA

As a use-case for above learnings, we will develop PBPK models for different small molecule drugs as use-cases for modeling drug-drug interactions and the concepts of age-related PK, in detail:
